# Image and Signal Filtering Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains all the materials for our master-level project on image and signal filtering. Our goal is to apply and analyze various filtering techniques to enhance the quality of both images and digital signals. We focus on optimizing filter parameters to improve performance in terms of noise reduction and signal clarity.
